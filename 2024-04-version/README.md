# README

This version of the double pass breadboard was first ordered in April, 2024. The overall design is similar to [2023-10-version](https://github.com/Jayich-Lab/double-pass-breadboard/tree/updated-README-for-2024-04-version/2023-10-version) but with several minor improvements
* Added an indentation to the beam splitter mount to fix the orientation of the PBS.
* Increased the number of mirror mount holes for the two mirrors before the output fiber port.
* Made the lens mount smaller to provide more room for translation.
* Made the waveplate mount sliding hole longer.
* Increased the space for the AOM mount sliding track to rotate.

### Parts to be machined
[STEP files](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17ZfntioATaHTT3IqYsM0CgbBKpX1f3IM)

* 1x breadboard_base
* 2x waveplate_mount
* 1x PBS_mount
* 1x iris_mount
* 1x AOM_mount
* 1x AOM adapter plate (there are different parts depending on the AOM)

### Mirror mount
* 6x [ST05-F2H ZeroDrift Optical Mount](https://www.newport.com/p/ST05-F2H)

 Compatible with other 1/2" mirror mounts.
 
### Wuhan Union Optic Inc.
* 2x Quarter waveplates
* 1x Half waveplate
* 1x Polarizing Beam Splitter (PBS)

We get our waveplates and PBS from [Union Optic](https://www.u-optic.com/). If the waveplates are not in the standard [Union Optic catalog](https://www.u-optic.com/product) we order custom waveplates, this is often the case.

Note: the optics above are an example that can be used for 728nm light. 

# Future improvements

* The addition of beam shaping optics before the AOM can improve diffraction efficiency.
