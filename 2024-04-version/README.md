# README

This version of the double pass breadboard was first ordered in April, 2024. The overall design is similar to [2023-10-version](https://github.com/Jayich-Lab/double-pass-breadboard/tree/updated-README-for-2024-04-version/2023-10-version) The changes made are:
* Added indentation to beam splitter mount to fix the orientation of PBS
* Increased the amount of mirror mount holes for the two mirrors before the output port
* Made lens mount smaller to have more room to translate
* Waveplate mount sliding hole is made longer
* Increased the room for AOM mount sliding track to move, which gives access to a wider range of angular position. 

The breadboard base is compatible with previous methods of mounting the lens and AOM.

### Parts to be machined
[STEP files](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17ZfntioATaHTT3IqYsM0CgbBKpX1f3IM)

* 1x breadboard_base
* 2x waveplate_mount
* 1x PBS_mount
* 1x iris_mount
* 1x AOM_mount
* 1x AOM specific adapter plate

### Newport mirror mount
* 6x [ST05-F2H ZeroDrift Optical Mount](https://www.newport.com/p/ST05-F2H)
 
### Wuhan Union Optic Inc.
* 2x Quarter waveplates
* 1x Half waveplate
* 1x Polarizing Beam Splitter (PBS)

We get our waveplates and PBS from [Union Optic](https://www.u-optic.com/). If the waveplates are not in the standard [Union Optic catalog](https://www.u-optic.com/product) we order custom waveplates, this is often the case.

### Thorlabs
* 1x [LMR1 Lens Mount](https://www.thorlabs.com/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=LMR1#ad-image-0)
* 1x [ID8 Mounted Standard Iris](https://www.thorlabs.com/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=ID8)
* 2x [HCA3 FiberBench Wall Plate](https://www.thorlabs.com/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=HCA3)
* 1x [LA1131-B-ML Plano-Convex Lens](https://www.thorlabs.com/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=LA1131-B-ML)
* 1x [DLM1 Dual Rotation Mount](https://www.thorlabs.com/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=DLM1#ad-image-0)
* 2x [PAF2A-A10B Achromatic FiberPort](https://www.thorlabs.com/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=PAF2A-A10B)
* 1x [BB05-E02-10 Broadband Dielectric Mirror](https://www.thorlabs.com/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=BB05-E02-10)
* 1x [LM1-B Rotation Mount](https://www.thorlabs.com/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=LM1-B)
* 1x [LM1-A Rotating Inner Carriage](https://www.thorlabs.com/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=LM1-A)

Note: the optics above are an example that can be used for 728nm light. When considering different wavelengths, the Fiber Port, PBS, mirrors, lens, and waveplates may need to be changed.

# Future improvements

* The addition of beam shaping optics before the AOM can greatly improve diffraction efficiency
