# README

This version of the double pass breadboard was first ordered in June, 2023. This is similar to the 2023-03-version but with a smaller base and unnecessary holes have been removed. The waveplate mounts have been extended to move the moutning screw further away from the waveplate housing. The fiber ports are mounted directly to the base.

# Parts

### Parts to be machined
[STEP files](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tglj8InTGoLq4X3He1ftFIY83VYrIk3X?usp=drive_link) for the parts to be machined.

* 2x waveplate_mount
* 1x PBS_mount
* 1x mirror_slide
* 1x iris_mount
* 1x lens_mount
* 1x breadboard_base

### Newport
* 6x [ST05-F2H ZeroDrift Optical Mount](https://www.newport.com/p/ST05-F2H)

### Wuhan Union Optic Inc
* 2x Quarter waveplates
* 1x Half waveplate 
* 1x Polarizing Beam Splitter (PBS)

We get our waveplates and PBS from [Union Optic](https://www.u-optic.com/index/siteid/2.html). If the waveplates are not in the standard [Union Optic catalog](https://www.u-optic.com/index/siteid/2.html) we order custom waveplates, this is often the case.

Note: the optics above are an example that can be used for 728nm light. When considering different wavelengths, the Fiber Port, PBS, mirrors, lens, and waveplates may need to be changed.

# Future improvements

* The fiber port mounting holes are too small and a washer needs to be used between the port and breadboard base. Make these deeper and give the coutner-bore a slightly larger radius to account for machining tolerances
* Fix the AOM position more firmly (eliminate the translational stage)
* Make more space around the iris holder so it does not get as close to the wavplate housing, possibly redesign how the iris is mounted
