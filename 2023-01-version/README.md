# README

This version of the double pass breadboard was ordered in January of 2023.  We had been referring to this as "version 2" in some loose versioning scheme.


# Next generation improvements to consider

* Iris holder cannot be flipped 180 degrees because it is too wide; in the current position the iris adjustment faces into the board and is difficult to reach with my fingers when the aperture is open  
* Some of the edges could be trimmed to make the board even smaller.
* Maybe use channels for the screw holes in the mirror mounts so they can be translated continuously (in addition to/instead of having multiple screw holes in the breadboard)  
* Check operation of the collars on mirror mounts - tightening them sometimes messes with alignment  
*  Mismatched models for the two fiber holders, should check if its a problem
