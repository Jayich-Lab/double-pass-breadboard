# double-pass-breadboard

This repo tracks our double pass breadboards.  The goal is to realize reliable and compact double pass breadboards.

Different versions of the breadboard are organized in directories labeled by the date (YY-MM) when the parts were *initially* ordered.

Each version directory includes a README with a link to the corresponding STEP files (GitHub doesn't support the STEP file format) for the parts to be machined.

# Parts

### Machined parts
Link to location in our drive of the .step files needed for the most up-to-date version of the board:

Hole tapping requirements: the 3.302 mm tapped holes need to be #8-32 screwed, the smaller ones (2.845 mm) will be #4-40 screwed, and the larger ones (5.157 mm diameter) should be 1/4''-20 screwed.





### To-dos
* Measure performance - long-term stability, temperature stability, 
* A guide to parts, assembly, etc.
