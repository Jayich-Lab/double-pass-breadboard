# double-pass-breadboard

This repo tracks our double pass breadboards.  The aim is to realize compact and reliable double pass breadboards.

Different versions of the breadboard are organized in directories labeled by the date that the parts were *initially* ordered - subsequent orders should not change the version.

Each directory should include STEP files for all the necessary parts.  At some point getting drawings in that can be viewed online would be good. Lab useful machining files, such as *.ipt, can certainly be included.

Ideally we get some performance results plotted in this week and include a guide to parts, assembly, etc.  Long term stability, temperature stability, are all to-dos.
