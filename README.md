# double-pass-breadboard

This repo tracks our double pass breadboards.  The goal is to realize stable, modular, and compact double pass AOM systems for controlling the frequency and amplitude of laser light.  This project was directly inspired by work in [Ike Chuang's group](http://web.mit.edu/~cua/www/quanta/).

Different versions of the breadboard are organized in directories labeled by the date (YY-MM) when the parts were *initially* ordered.  Each directory includes a README with a link to the corresponding STEP files (GitHub doesn't support the STEP file format) for the parts to be machined.

# To-dos
* Measure performance - long-term stability, temperature stability.

### Polarizing Beam Splitter Handling

We use [Devcon 2 Ton Epoxy](https://itwperformancepolymers.com/products/devcon/adhesives-sealants/devcon-2-ton-epoxy) to secure polarizing beam splitter (PBS) cubes to their mounts. 
- Note: use only a little dab of epoxy for a single corner and avoid the joint between the two halves of the cube. If epoxy contacts this joint, it will seep in over time, eventually ruining the PBS.


### Maximizing Double Pass Efficiency
* Adjust the beam path until it is level over the length of the breadboard.
* Use a beam profiler to measure the beam far away (~80cm) from the input fiber port, and minimize beam divergence using the three ZÎ¸ adjusters. This step is important to get decent double pass efficiency and reasonable output fiber coupling efficiency.
* Adjust the height of the incoming beam so the beam passes through the center of the AOM aperture. Keep the beam level when adjusting the beam height. 
* Adjust the AOM's angle using the AOM mount sliding track to maximize the diffraction efficiency at the desired AOM center driving frequency.  
* Measure the single pass efficiency and bandwidth.
* Place an plano-convex lens a focal length (f = 50 mm) away from the AOM with the convex side facing the AOM. Adjust the position of the plano-convex lens so the 0th order beam passes through the center of the lens. This step is crucial for getting a good double pass efficiency.
* Place the beam profiler a focal length away from the lens, and find the spot where the beam width is the smallest.
* Put a flat mirror at the smallest beam width position, and adjust mirror to retro-reflect the beam. 
* Adjust the quarter wave plate and the flat mirror until the light reflected back from the PBS is maximized. 
* Check the double pass efficiency and bandwidth before fiber coupling. The bandwidth will be smaller, but comparable to the single pass bandwidth recorded in step 5.
* If the bandwidth is significantly smaller for the double pass, then adjust the distance between the AOM and the lens to improve the bandwidth.
* Couple the light into the output fiber using the two mirrors before the output port. For detailed instructions on how to fiber couple with [Thorlabs PAF2 Series Collimators](https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=2940), see [Thorlabs manual](https://www.thorlabs.com/_sd.cfm?fileName=TTN132194-D02.pdf&partNumber=PAF2A-A10A) chapter 6.


# Machining notes

### Machined parts

Hole tapping requirements: the 3.302 mm tapped holes need to be #8-32 screwed, the smaller ones (2.845 mm) should be #4-40 screwed, and the larger ones (5.157 mm diameter) should be 1/4''-20 screwed.
