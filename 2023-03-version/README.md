# README

This version of the double pass breadboard was first ordered in March, 2023.  This is very similar to the 2023-01-version - it is slightly smaller and includes more moutning holes.

# Parts
 
### Parts to be machined
[STEP files](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1z8gYKQsrM2GSww2NHeTRoyboD5y0jY1v?usp=share_link) for the parts to be machined.

* 2x waveplate_mount_step
* 1x PBS_mount_step
* 1x mirror_slide_step
* 1x iris_mount_step
* 1x board-2023-03


### Newport
* 6x [ST05-F2H ZeroDrift Optical Mount](https://www.newport.com/p/ST05-F2H) (interchangeable with [Thorlabs Polaris half inch low drift mirror mounts](https://www.thorlabs.com/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=POLARIS-K05C4))

### Wuhan Union Optic Inc
* 2x Quarter waveplates
* 1x Half waveplate 

We get our waveplates from [Union Optic](https://www.u-optic.com/index/siteid/2.html). If the waveplates are not in the standard [Union Optic catalog](https://www.u-optic.com/index/siteid/2.html) we order custom waveplates, this is often the case.

* 2x [PAF2A-A10B Achromatic FiberPort](https://www.thorlabs.com/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=PAF2A-A10B)
* 1x [PBS202 Polarizing Beam Splitter](https://www.thorlabs.com/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=PBS202)
* 1x [BB05-E02-10 Broadband Dielectric Mirror](https://www.thorlabs.com/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=BB05-E02-10)
* 1x [RSP1 Rotation Mount](https://www.thorlabs.com/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=RSP1#ad-image-0)

Note: the optics above are an example that can be used for 728nm light. When considering different wavelengths, the Fiber Port, PBS, mirrors, lens, and waveplates may need to be changed.

# Future improvements

* The lens mount should be able to be translated (similar to the double pass mirror mount).
* Iris holder cannot be flipped 180 degrees because it is too wide; in the current position the iris adjustment faces into the board and is difficult to reach with my fingers when the aperture is open  
* Some of the edges could be trimmed to make the board even smaller.
* Maybe use channels for the screw holes in the mirror mounts so they can be translated continuously; although, this may complicate the design with little benefit.  
* Check operation of the collars on mirror mounts - tightening them sometimes messes with alignment  
* Fiber holders should be the same model
