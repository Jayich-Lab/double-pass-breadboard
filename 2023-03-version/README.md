# README

This version of the double pass breadboard was ordered in March of 2023.  We had been referring to this as "version 2" in some loose versioning scheme.

# Next generation improvements to consider

* The lens mount should be able to be translated (similar to the double pass mirror mount).
* Iris holder cannot be flipped 180 degrees because it is too wide; in the current position the iris adjustment faces into the board and is difficult to reach with my fingers when the aperture is open  
* Some of the edges could be trimmed to make the board even smaller.
* Maybe use channels for the screw holes in the mirror mounts so they can be translated continuously; although, this may complicate the design with little benefit.  
* Check operation of the collars on mirror mounts - tightening them sometimes messes with alignment  
* Fiber holders should be the same model
