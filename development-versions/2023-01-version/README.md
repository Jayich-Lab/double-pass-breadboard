# README

This version of the double pass breadboard was first ordered in January, 2023. This is smaller than the 2022-12 version. 

The PBS mount in the picture below is a hack. With all the mounting parts this is not needed (we were waiting on an order).

We custom order our waveplates from [Union Optic](https://www.u-optic.com/index/siteid/2.html), as the frequencies we need are not always in Thorlabs or Union Optics catalogues. 728 nm waveplates, for example, are not listed in either website. Before placing a custom order, check [Thorlabs](https://www.thorlabs.com/) and [Union Optic](https://www.u-optic.com/index/siteid/2.html) to see if it is readily available.
